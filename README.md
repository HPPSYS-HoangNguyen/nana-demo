# nana-demo
This is collection of small examples borrowed from any possible source, mostly from documents and blogs posted by Jin Hao.  

The simple applications in the root directory show how to combine a few features of Nana GUI programing.  

The aim of each .cpp files in the "examples" directory is to show how to use one feature.  

All are updated to Nana v1.0.2.  

Need periodical revision and adaptation.  

This is also a test for each change in nana.
